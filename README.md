# Bible Reading Plan

Reading the Bible cover to cover from Genesis to Revelation is great but has the downside that the order of the books is such that it takes you a long time until you reach the New Testament, which can be demotivating.

There are various solutions, for example, some read the Old and New Testaments in parallel.

However, I haven't felt happy with that, so I created this small program to automatically generate a pathway through the Bible to read it cover to cover. This program randomizes the order of the Bible books while ensuring that the Old Testament and New Testament are read in a balanced way.
